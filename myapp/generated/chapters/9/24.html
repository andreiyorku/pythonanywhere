<h1>How do marginal costs behave as businesses increase output?</h1>
As output increases, marginal cost increases for businesses near capacity or with costlier inputs. Diminishing returns â€” as output increases, productivity decreases, raising marginal costs. Businesses operating near capacity, or shifting to more expensive inputs, have increasing marginal costs to increase output. As output increases, marginal cost is usually constant for businesses not near capacity.
