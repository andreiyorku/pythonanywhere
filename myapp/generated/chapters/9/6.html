<h1>What did Adam Smith say about monopoly and competition pricing?</h1>
"The price of monopoly is... the highest which can be squeezed out of the buyers, or which... they will consent to give. The natural price, or the price of free competition, on the contrary, ... is the lowest which the sellers can commonly afford to take, and at the same time continue their business." â€” Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, 1776
