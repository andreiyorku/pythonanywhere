<h1>What happened to Blacks photography retailer, and why?</h1>
"Photography retailer Blacks is closing all of its 59 stores, victim of a fast-changing digital industry and high-quality smartphone cameras and Instagram posts." "With smartphones, Canadians are taking more photos than ever before but having fewer of them printed commercially, hurting businesses such as Blacks." "The shutdown of the stores... will leave 485 employees without jobs."
