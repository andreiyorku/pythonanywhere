<h1>Comparative Advantage</h1>
Ability to produce a product or service at a lower <strong>opportunity cost</strong> than another producer. This is the key to mutually beneficial trade: it allows each trader to consume outside their own Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) and enables mutually beneficial gains from specialization and trade. Trade makes individuals better off when they specialize in the product/service where they have a comparative advantage and trade for other products or services.
