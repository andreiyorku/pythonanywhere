<h1>Circular Flow Model</h1>
Depiction of how households, businesses, and the government interact: Households provide inputs (labor, natural resources, capital equipment, entrepreneurial ability). These inputs are used to produce goods and services. Businesses sell products/services to households (output market), and households receive income and spend it on goods and services. Government sets the rules of the game and can interact at any point.
