<h1>Opportunity Cost</h1>
<strong>Scarcity</strong> leads to choice, and choice always involves trade-offs. <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong> = the <em>true choice</em> or <strong>the best alternative given up</strong>. This is <u>more important</u> than just the monetary cost. Smart choices are made by comparing: <strong>Value of what you get</strong> vs <strong>Value of what you give up</strong>. Opportunity cost changes as costs and benefits change. <strong>Incentives</strong> are rewards and penalties for choices: People are more likely to choose actions with <em>positive incentives</em> (rewards) and tend to avoid penalties (negative incentives). <u>Opportunity Cost Formula:</u> <strong>Opportunity Cost = What you Give Up / What you Get</strong>. Opportunity cost decreases when things become cheaper and increases when things become more expensive.
