<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<h1>Scarcity</h1>
<p><strong>Scarcity</strong> occurs due to limited: <em>Time, Money, Energy</em>. <strong>Economics:</strong> Individuals, Businesses, and Governments make the <em>best choices</em> to get what they want, and these choices affect the market.</p>

<h1>Opportunity Cost</h1>
<p><strong>Scarcity</strong> leads to choice, and choice always involves trade-offs. <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong> = the <em>true choice</em> or <strong>the best alternative given up</strong>. This is <u>more important</u> than just the monetary cost. Smart choices are made by comparing: <strong>Value of what you get</strong> vs <strong>Value of what you give up</strong>. Opportunity cost changes as costs and benefits change. <strong>Incentives</strong> are rewards and penalties for choices: People are more likely to choose actions with <em>positive incentives</em> (rewards) and tend to avoid penalties (negative incentives). <u>Opportunity Cost Formula:</u> <strong>Opportunity Cost = What you Give Up / What you Get</strong>. Opportunity cost decreases when things become cheaper and increases when things become more expensive.</p>

<h1>Voluntary Trade</h1>
<p>Voluntary trade happens when a person feels that what they get is greater than what they give up.</p>

<h1>Absolute Advantage</h1>
<p>Ability to produce a product or service at a lower <strong>absolute cost</strong>.</p>

<h1>Comparative Advantage</h1>
<p>Ability to produce a product or service at a lower <strong>opportunity cost</strong> than another producer. This is the key to mutually beneficial trade: it allows each trader to consume outside their own Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) and enables mutually beneficial gains from specialization and trade. Trade makes individuals better off when they specialize in the product/service where they have a comparative advantage and trade for other products or services.</p>

<h1>Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)</h1>
<p>A graph showing the maximum combination of products/services that can be produced with existing inputs.</p>

<h1>Gains from Trade Example</h1>
<p>Example table (Jill and Marie): Jill gives up 2 logs of wood for 1 loaf of bread. Marie gives up 1/2 log of wood for 1 loaf of bread. Jill gives up 1/2 loaf of bread for 1 log of wood. Marie gives up 2 loaves of bread for 1 log of wood. <strong>Comparative Advantage:</strong> Marie has a comparative advantage in bread-making (lower opportunity cost), while Jill has a comparative advantage in wood-chopping (lower opportunity cost). <u>Key insight:</u> Gains from trade happen without anyone working harder or without any technological improvement.</p>

<h1>Example Data</h1>
<p><strong>Canada and Argentina Trade Data:</strong> Corn: Canada = 2, Argentina = 1.2. Wheat: Canada = 1/2, Argentina = 0.8.</p>

<h1>Circular Flow Model</h1>
<p>Depiction of how households, businesses, and the government interact: Households provide inputs (labor, natural resources, capital equipment, entrepreneurial ability). These inputs are used to produce goods and services. Businesses sell products/services to households (output market), and households receive income and spend it on goods and services. Government sets the rules of the game and can interact at any point.</p>

<h1>Three Key Models to Smart Choices</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>. 2. <strong>Additional Benefit vs Additional Opportunity Cost</strong>. 3. <strong>Benefits vs Costs (implicit) vs Externalities</strong>.</p>

<h1>Models in Economics</h1>
<p><strong>Positive Statements:</strong> Evaluated as true or false (fact-based). <strong>Normative Statements:</strong> What you believe should be; involves value judgments.</p>

<h1>Marginal and Implicit Costs</h1>
<p><strong>Marginal = "Additional" Great Choice</strong>. <strong>Implicit Costs = Opportunity Costs</strong> of investing your own money or time.</p>
