<h1>Causes of Demand Increases</h1>
Demand increases if preferences increase, the price of a substitute rises, the price of a complement falls, income increases for normal goods (buy more when income increases), income decreases for inferior goods (buy less when income decreases), expected future price rises, or the number of consumers increases.
