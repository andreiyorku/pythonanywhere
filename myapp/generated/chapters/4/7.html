<h1>Market Imbalances: Shortages & Surpluses</h1>
<b>Frustrated Buyers:</b> When <u>market price is too low</u>, a shortage (excess demand) occurs, meaning <i>quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied</i>. This creates <u>pressure for prices to rise</u>. Rising prices signal businesses to <b>increase supply</b> and consumers to <b>reduce demand</b>, eventually eliminating the shortage. Conversely, a <b>surplus</b> occurs when <u>quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded</u>, creating <u>pressure for prices to fall</u>. Falling prices signal businesses to <b>reduce supply</b> and consumers to <b>increase demand</b>, eliminating the surplus.
