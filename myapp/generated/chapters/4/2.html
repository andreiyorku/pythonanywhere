<h1>Market Efficiency</h1>
<p>- Coordinates smart choices of businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>- Consumers buy only products &amp; services where marginal benefit &gt; price.</p>
<p>- Prices just cover all opportunity costs of production.</p>
<p>- Total surplus (consumer surplus + producer surplus) is maximized.</p>
