<h1>Comparative Statics (Analyzing Changes)</h1>
Thinking like an economist means using <b>comparative statistics</b> â€” <i>comparing two equilibrium outcomes to isolate the effect of changing one factor at a time</i>. You start with an <b>initial equilibrium</b> where demand and supply intersect. Then, you change one variable and compare the new equilibrium (price and quantity). Importantly, <b>price and quantity changes are results, not causes, of economic events</b>.
