<h1>Understanding the Market-Clearing Price</h1>
The <b>market-clearing price</b> is also called the <b>equilibrium price</b>, where <u>quantity demanded equals quantity supplied</u>. Price signals create incentives so that while each person acts in their <u>own self-interest</u>, their actions are coordinated through <i>Adam Smith’s invisible hand</i>. The result is the <b>miracle of markets</b> — constantly adjusting production of goods and services to meet changing wants.
