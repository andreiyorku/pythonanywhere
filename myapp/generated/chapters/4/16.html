<h1>What Makes Markets Efficient?</h1>
Efficient market outcomes coordinate <u>smart choices</u> by ensuring that consumers buy only products where <b>marginal benefit exceeds price</b>, and products are produced at the <b>lowest cost</b>, where prices just cover all opportunity costs. Goods and services flow to the <b>consumers most willing and able to pay</b>, maximizing <b>total surplus (consumer plus producer surplus)</b>.
