<h1>Deadweight Loss and Inefficient Outcomes</h1>
<b>Deadweight loss:</b> This is the <u>decrease in total surplus</u> compared to an efficient outcome. Whenever an inefficient outcome occurs, <b>deadweight loss subtracts from total surplus</b>. This can happen in two ways: <b>Producing too little</b>, where valuable goods are not produced, or <b>Producing too much</b>, where goods are overproduced beyond what consumers value.
