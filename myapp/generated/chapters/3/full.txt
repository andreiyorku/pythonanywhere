<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<h1>Supply</h1>
<p>Supply refers to a business’s willingness to produce a particular product or service because the price covers all opportunity costs.</p>

<h1>Quantity Supplied</h1>
<p>Quantity supplied is the actual quantity you plan to supply at a given price.</p>

<h1>Marginal Opportunity Cost</h1>
<p>Marginal opportunity cost is the complete term for any cost relevant to a smart decision. All opportunity costs are marginal costs, and vice versa.</p>

<h1>The Law of Supply</h1>
<p>Increasing marginal opportunity costs arise because inputs are not equally productive in all activities. Where inputs are equally productive in all activities, marginal opportunity costs are constant. The law of supply states that if the price of a product or service rises, quantity supplied increases.</p>

<h1>Market Supply</h1>
<p>Market supply is the sum of supplies of all businesses willing to produce a particular product or service.</p>

<h1>Supply Curve</h1>
<p>The supply curve shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied, holding other factors constant. There are two ways to read a supply curve: read over and down (from price to quantity supplied), or read up and over (from quantity supplied to price). The marginal cost curve shows the minimum price a business will accept to cover all marginal opportunity costs of production.</p>

<h1>Price vs Other Influences</h1>
<p>Quantity supplied changes only with a change in price. All other influences on business decisions change supply itself.</p>

<h1>What Can Change Supply</h1>
<p>Supply is a catch-all term summarizing all possible influences on a business’s willingness to produce a particular product or service. An increase in supply means businesses are more willing to supply, shifting the supply curve to the right. A decrease in supply means businesses are less willing to supply, shifting the supply curve to the left.</p>

<h1>Factors that Change Supply</h1>
<p>Supply changes with changes in technology, prices of related products or services produced, price of inputs, expected future prices, number of businesses, and the environment. Specifically: improvements in technology, new methods helping production, falling input prices, falling prices of related products/services, falling expected future prices, and an increase in the number of businesses all increase supply.</p>

<h1>Marginal Costs of Inputs</h1>
<p>Businesses must pay higher prices to obtain more of an input, causing opportunity costs to change with circumstances. Marginal costs of additional inputs (like labor) are ultimately opportunity costs — the best alternative use of inputs. To buy inputs, businesses must pay the price matching the best opportunity cost of the input owner.</p>

<h1>All Costs are Opportunity Costs</h1>
<p>All costs are opportunity costs, and smart choices account for these.</p>

<h1>Sunk Costs</h1>
<p>Sunk costs (that cannot be reversed) are not part of opportunity costs and do not influence smart, forward-looking decisions.</p>

<h1>Law of Supply Restated</h1>
<p>If the price of a product or service rises, quantity supplied increases.</p>

<h1>How Businesses Respond to Prices</h1>
<p>Businesses increase production when higher prices either create higher profits or cover higher marginal opportunity costs of production.</p>
