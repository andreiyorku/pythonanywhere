<h1>What Can Change Supply</h1>
Supply is a catch-all term summarizing all possible influences on a businessâ€™s willingness to produce a particular product or service. An increase in supply means businesses are more willing to supply, shifting the supply curve to the right. A decrease in supply means businesses are less willing to supply, shifting the supply curve to the left.
