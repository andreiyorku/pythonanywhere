<h1>Supply Curve</h1>
The supply curve shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied, holding other factors constant. There are two ways to read a supply curve: read over and down (from price to quantity supplied), or read up and over (from quantity supplied to price). The marginal cost curve shows the minimum price a business will accept to cover all marginal opportunity costs of production.
