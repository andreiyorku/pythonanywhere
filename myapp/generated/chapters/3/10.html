<h1>Marginal Costs of Inputs</h1>
Businesses must pay higher prices to obtain more of an input, causing opportunity costs to change with circumstances. Marginal costs of additional inputs (like labor) are ultimately opportunity costs â€” the best alternative use of inputs. To buy inputs, businesses must pay the price matching the best opportunity cost of the input owner.
