<h1>Factors that Change Supply</h1>
Supply changes with changes in technology, prices of related products or services produced, price of inputs, expected future prices, number of businesses, and the environment. Specifically: improvements in technology, new methods helping production, falling input prices, falling prices of related products/services, falling expected future prices, and an increase in the number of businesses all increase supply.
