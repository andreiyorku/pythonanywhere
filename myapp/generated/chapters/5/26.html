<h1>Income Elasticity of Demand</h1>
<p>Income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of demand for a product/service to a change in income. The formula is: Income Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income). Income elasticity is positive for normal goods, meaning as income increases, demand increases, causing a rightward shift of the demand curve.</p>
