# =========================
# Path Setup
# =========================
CHAPTERS_DIR = os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'myapp', 'generated', 'chapters')
# This is the root folder where all chapters and key points are stored.

# =========================
# Chapter Retrieval
# =========================
def get_generated_chapters():
    # Lists all chapter folders (1, 2, 3, ...) inside CHAPTERS_DIR.
    # Returns a sorted list of chapter numbers (as integers).
    pass

def get_files_in_chapter(chapter_number):
    # Lists all key point files inside a specific chapter folder.
    # Each key point file is named like "1.html", "2.html", etc.
    # Returns a sorted list of key point numbers (as integers).
    pass

# =========================
# QA File Path Helper
# =========================
def get_qa_file_path(chapter_number, key_point_number):
    # Builds and returns the file path for the QA file related to a key point.
    # Example: chapters/3/2.qa.json
    pass

# =========================
# Title Extraction from Key Point File
# =========================
def get_key_point_title(chapter_number, key_point_number):
    # Opens a key point HTML file and reads its title (from <h1> or <h2>).
    # If no title is found, returns a generic "Key Point {number}".
    # If the title starts with "Chapter X:", that prefix is removed.
    pass

# =========================
# Navigation: Move to Next Key Point
# =========================
def move_to_next_key_point(request, chapter_number, key_point_number, is_random_across_chapters):
    # Moves user to the next key point.
    #
    # Mode 1: Random Across All Chapters
    # - Collect all key points across all chapters.
    # - Redirect to a random key point.
    #
    # Mode 2: Sequential Within Current Chapter
    # - Moves to the next key point within the same chapter.
    # - If at the end of the chapter, redirect to chapter overview.
    pass

# =========================
# Bulk Import Processor
# =========================
def process_bulk_chapter_content(bulk_content):
    # Splits a pasted bulk HTML block into individual key point files.
    #
    # Step 1: Extract Chapter Number from <h1>.
    # Step 2: Create chapter folder if missing.
    # Step 3: Split the bulk content into individual key points.
    #         Each key point starts with <h2> like "1. Introduction".
    # Step 4: Write each key point into a separate HTML file.
    # Step 5: Return success message with how many key points were saved.
    pass

# Folder and File Structure Summary
# =========================
# chapters/
# ├── 1/                 # Chapter 1 folder
# │   ├── 1.html          # Key Point 1 (content)
# │   ├── 1.qa.json       # Key Point 1 (question/answer data)
# │   ├── 2.html
# │   ├── 2.qa.json
# ├── 2/                 # Chapter 2 folder
# │   ├── ...

# =========================
# File Content Summary
# =========================
# Example Key Point HTML:
# <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
# <p>This is the introduction text.</p>

# Example Key Point QA JSON:
# {
#     "question": "What is the introduction about?",
#     "weight": 1.0
# }

# =========================
# Logic Flow Summary
# =========================
# 1. User opens a chapter editor page (handled in views.py).
# 2. System loads key point files via these helper functions.
# 3. When saving, each key point gets:
#    - One HTML file (content)
#    - One JSON file (question)
# 4. Bulk import creates many key point files at once.
# 5. The system supports:
#    - Sequential movement within a chapter.
#    - Random jumping across all chapters.
# 6. Titles are auto-extracted from HTML content.
# 7. Titles are "cleaned" by removing unnecessary prefixes like "Chapter X:".

# =========================
# Final Note
# =========================
# This file is a **utility module**.
# It does NOT display pages or handle user requests directly.
# Instead, it works behind the scenes:
# - Listing chapters and key points
# - Reading and writing files
# - Parsing bulk content
# - Handling navigation logic
#
# All user-facing views (buttons, forms, etc.) live in views.py.
# This file just helps views.py manage the content storage part.

# In short:
# - Chapters are folders.
# - Key Points are files inside chapters.
# - Each Key Point = Content File + QA File.

# That’s the whole system explained!
