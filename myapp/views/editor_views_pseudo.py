# =========================
# Path Helpers
# =========================
def get_chapter_path(chapter_number):
    # This gives the folder path for a specific chapter.
    # Example: If chapter_number = 3, returns "chapters/3/"
    pass


def get_key_point_paths(chapter_number, key_point_number):
    # This gives two file paths:
    # - One for the HTML content file (like "chapters/3/2.html")
    # - One for the QA question file (like "chapters/3/2.qa.json")
    pass


# =========================
# Core View: Chapter Editor
# =========================
def chapter_editor_view(request):
    # This is the main page you see when editing.
    # It handles buttons like:
    # - Next Chapter
    # - Previous Chapter
    # - Add Chapter Between
    # - Save Key Point
    # - Bulk Import
    #
    # When you press a button, this view figures out what action to take.
    pass


# =========================
# Key Point Save/Append
# =========================
def save_key_point_from_request(request, chapter_number, key_point_number):
    # This takes the text you typed in (title, content, question)
    # and saves it into two files:
    # - An HTML file with the content.
    # - A QA JSON file with the question.
    #
    # If there's already a file there, this REPLACES it completely.
    pass


def append_to_key_point_view(request):
    # This is like "Add More Content" for an existing key point.
    # It does NOT replace the whole file — instead, it adds new content to the end.
    pass


def build_append_content(request):
    # This is a helper that gathers:
    # - A sub-title (if you typed one)
    # - A paragraph (if you typed one)
    # - Any uploaded images
    #
    # It combines all of these into one chunk of HTML text.
    pass


# =========================
# Bulk Import
# =========================
def process_bulk_import(request):
    # This handles the "bulk import" feature.
    # If you paste a giant block of HTML, this will:
    # - Split it into chapters and key points (based on <h1> and <h2> tags)
    # - Automatically save them into files.
    #
    # It makes adding lots of content fast!
    pass


# =========================
# Image Handling
# =========================
def save_uploaded_images(chapter_number, key_point_number, images):
    # This takes images you uploaded and saves them into the right folder.
    # Example: "chapters/3/images/"
    #
    # It also creates <img> tags so the images show up when you view the key point.
    pass


# =========================
# Utility Shifters (Move Stuff Around)
# =========================
def shift_chapters_up(starting_chapter):
    # Imagine you have:
    # Chapter 1
    # Chapter 2
    # Chapter 3
    #
    # If you add something between Chapters 1 and 2, we need to "push" Chapters 2 and 3 forward.
    # This function handles that pushing.
    pass


def shift_key_points_up(chapter_number, starting_point):
    # This works the same way as shifting chapters, but for key points inside a chapter.
    #
    # Example:
    # Key Point 1
    # Key Point 2
    #
    # If you add something between those, it "pushes" Key Point 2 forward.
    pass


# =========================
# Folder and File Structure Summary
# =========================
# For each chapter, the files are stored like this:

# chapters/
# ├── 1/
# │   ├── 1.html    (Key Point 1 content)
# │   ├── 1.qa.json (Key Point 1 question)
# │   ├── 2.html
# │   ├── 2.qa.json
# │   ├── images/
# │   │   ├── img_1_1.jpg
# │   │   ├── img_2_1.jpg
# ├── 2/
# │   ├── ...

# =========================
# What Each File Contains
# =========================
# Key Point HTML:
# <h1>Title of Key Point</h1>
# <p>Main text here...</p>
# <img src="..." />

# Key Point QA (question):
# {
#     "question": "What is the title?",
#     "weight": 1.0
# }

# =========================
# Summary of Logic Flow
# =========================
# 1. User opens the editor —> chapter_editor_view loads Chapter 1, Key Point 1.
# 2. User presses "Next Chapter" —> chapter_editor_view loads the next chapter.
# 3. User types text + images —> save_key_point_from_request saves files.
# 4. User inserts new point between others —> shift_key_points_up moves files down.
# 5. User uploads images —> save_uploaded_images stores them and adds <img> tags.

# =========================
# Final Note
# =========================
# This file is basically the "traffic controller" for your chapter editor.
# It:
# - Shows the right content when you navigate.
# - Saves everything you type or upload.
# - Moves files around if needed.
# - Handles bulk imports so you can paste lots of content quickly.
# - Keeps everything neat and organized into folders and files.

# In short:
# - Chapters are folders.
# - Key Points are files inside chapters.
# - Every key point has:
#     - An HTML file (content)
#     - A JSON file (question)

# That’s the whole logic in plain English!
