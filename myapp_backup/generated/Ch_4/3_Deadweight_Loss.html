<h1>Chapter 4, 3. Deadweight Loss</h1>
<p>- Deadweight loss = Decrease in total surplus compared to an economically efficient outcome.</p>
<p>- For an inefficient outcome, deadweight loss is subtracted, so total surplus is less than for an efficient outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Minecraft GTNH Application:</strong> Using inefficient crafting recipes wastes resources, increasing deadweight loss.</p>
